# Terminology
The terms "**control**", "**benchmark**", and "**baseline**" are used often in the Azure Security Benchmark documentation and it's important to understand how Azure uses those terms.

* A **control** is a high-level description of a feature or activity that needs to be addressed and is not specific to a technology or implementation.
* A **benchmark** contains security recommendations for a specific technology, such as Azure. The recommendations are categorized by the control to which they belong.
* A **baseline** is the implementation of the benchmark on the individual Azure service. Each organization decides benchmark recommendation and corresponding configurations are needed in the Azure implementation scope.
