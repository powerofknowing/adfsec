# Azure Data Factory Security Baseline

## 1. Network Security
### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks
* Azure SSIS-IR
    * NSG Port 3389 open by default, lock it down.
* Self-Hosted IR
    * Ensure that your virtual network subnet deployment has an NSG configured to allow only administrative access.
* Where Private Link is available, use private endpoints to secure any resources being linked to your Azure Data Factory pipeline, such as Azure SQL Server.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs
* Use Azure Security Center and remediate network protection recommendations.
* Enable network security group (NSG) flow logs for the NSG protecting your Integration Runtime deployment.
* Send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic auditing.
* Send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace.
* Use Traffic Analytics to provide insights.

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications
N/A

### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses
* Enable DDoS Protection Standard on the virtual networks associated with your Integration Runtime deployment for protection from distributed denial-of-service attacks.

### 1.5: Record network packets
* Enable network security group (NSG) flow logs for the NSG protecting your Integration Runtime deployment and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic auditing.

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
* Inspect outbound traffic from Azure-SSIS IR by routing traffic initiated from Azure-SSIS IR to on-premises firewall appliance via Azure ExpressRoute force tunneling or to a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) that supports IDS/IPS capabilities.

### 1.7: Manage traffic to web applications
N/A

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules
*  Use VNet service tags to define network access controls on network security group (NSG). Use service tags (e.g., DataFactoryManagement) in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules.

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices
* Define and implement standard security configurations for network settings and network resources associated with ADF instances with Azure Policy.

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules
* Use tags for resources related to network security and traffic flow for ADF instances to provide metadata and logical organization.

### 1.11: Use automated tools to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes
* Use Azure Activity Log to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes for network resources related to ADF instances. 
* Create alerts within Azure Monitor that will trigger when changes to critical network resources take place.

## 2. Logging and Monitoring
### 2.1: Use approved time synchronization sources
* Microsoft maintains the time source used for Azure resources, such as Azure Data Factory for timestamps in the logs.

### 2.2: Configure central security log management
* Ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by ADF.
* Within Azure Monitor, query the Log Analytics workspace that is configured to receive ADF activity logs.
* Use Azure Storage Accounts for long-term/archival log storage.
* Use Event Hub for exporting data to other systems, if needed.
* Enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel.
* Integrate ADF with Git to leverage source control benefits.

### 2.3: Enable audit logging for Azure resources
* Control plane audit logging: Enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure Event Hubs, or Azure Storage Account for archive.
* Use Azure Activity Log data to determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level.

### 2.4: Collect security logs from operating systems
* IF running your Integration Runtime in an Azure Virtual Machine (VM), use Azure Monitor to collect data from the virtual machine.

### 2.5: Configure security log storage retention
* Enable diagnostic settings for Azure Data Factory. 
* If choosing to store logs in a Log Analytics Workspace, set LAW retention period according to organization's compliance regulations. 
* Use Azure Storage Accounts for long-term/archival storage.

### 2.6: Monitor and review Logs
* Enable diagnostic settings for Azure Data Factory and send logs to a Log Analytics workspace.
* Use Log Analytics to analyze and monitor logs for anomalous behavior and regularly review results. 
* Ensure that diagnostic settings are enabled for any data stores related to Azure Data Factory deployments.

### 2.7: Enable alerts for anomalous activities
* Raise alerts on supported metrics in ADF by going to the Alerts & Metrics section in Azure Monitor.
* Configure diagnostic settings for Azure Data Factory and send logs to a Log Analytics workspace.
* Enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel.

### 2.8: Centralize anti-malware logging
* IF running IR in an Azure VM, use Microsoft Antimalware. 
* Configure VMs to log events to an Azure Storage Account.
* Configure a LAW to ingest the events from storage accounts and create alerts where appropriate.

### 2.9: Enable DNS query logging
N/A. ADF does not process or produce DNS-related logs.

### 2.10: Enable command-line audit logging
* IF running IR in an Azure VM, enable command-line audit logging. 
* ASC provides Security Event log monitoring for Azure VMs. 
* ASC provisions the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) on all supported Azure VMs
* MMA agent enables the process creation event 4688 and the CommandLine field inside event 4688.
* New processes created on the VM are recorded by EventLog and monitored by Security Centerâ€™s detection services.

## 3. Identity and Access control
### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts
* Ensure to track and reconcile user access on a regular basis. To create Data Factory instances, the user account used to sign in to Azure must be a member of the contributor or owner role, or an administrator of the Azure subscription.
* Use the Azure AD PowerShell module to perform ad hoc queries to discover accounts that are members of administrative groups that have administrative access to the control plane of ADF instances.
* If running Self-Hosted IR, VM running Self-Hosted IR may have local accounts as well. Both local and domain accounts should be reviewed and managed, normally with a minimum footprint.
* Use PIM Just-in-Time VM access to reduce the availability of administrative permissions

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable
* N/A

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts
* Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts for access to the Azure control plane (Azure portal) as well as the ADF console. 
* Use ASC Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts within Azure AD.

### 3.4: Use single sign-on (SSO) with Azure Active Directory
* Use an Azure app registration (service principal) to retrieve a token that the application or function can use to access and interact with Recovery Services vaults.

### 3.5: Use multi-factor authentication for all Azure Active Directory based access

### 3.6: Use dedicated machines (Privileged Access Workstations) for all administrative tasks
* Use privileged access workstations (PAW) with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) configured to log into and configure Azure resources.

### 3.7: Log and alert on suspicious activities from administrative accounts
* Use AAD security reports for generation of logs and alerts when suspicious or unsafe activity occurs in the environment. Use ASC to monitor identity and access activity.
* If running Self-Hosted IR, onboard VM to Azure Sentinel.

### 3.8: Manage Azure resources from only approved locations
* Use Conditional Access Named Locations to allow access from only specific logical groupings of IP address ranges or countries/regions.
* Ensure that ADF Self-Hosted IRs are part of Conditional Access named locations.

### 3.9: Use Azure Active Directory
* Ensure that ADF is associated with a managed identity for Azure resources that represents the specific data factory. 
* Use managed identity for Azure SQL Database authentication. 
* If running Self-Hosted IR, onboard VM to Azure Sentinel.

### 3.10: Regularly review and reconcile user access
* Use Azure Identity Access Reviews to efficiently manage group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments.

### 3.11: Monitor attempts to access deactivated credentials
* Azure Active Directory (AD) sign-in activity, audit and risk event log sources allows to integrate with any SIEM/Monitoring tool. 
* Streamline this process by creating diagnostic settings for Azure AD user accounts and sending the audit logs and sign-in logs to a Log Analytics workspace. 
* Configure desired log alerts within Log Analytics.
* If running Self-Hosted IR, onboard VM to Azure Sentinel.

### 3.12: Alert on account login behavior deviation
* Use Azure Active Directory (AD) as the central authentication and authorization system for ADF resources, such Azure SQL Database or Azure Virtual Machines. 
* For account login behavior deviation on the control plane (the Azure portal), use Azure AD Identity Protection and risk detection features to configure automated responses to detected suspicious actions related to user identities. 
* Ingest data into Azure Sentinel for further investigation.

### 3.13: Provide Microsoft with access to relevant customer data during support scenarios
* In support scenarios where Microsoft needs to access customer data, Azure Customer Lockbox provides an interface for customers to review and approve or reject customer data access requests. 
* While Azure Lockbox is not available for ADF itself, Azure Lockbox does support Azure SQL Database and Azure Virtual Machines.

## 4. Data Protection
### 4.1: Maintain an inventory of sensitive Information
* Use the Azure SQL Database data discovery and classification feature to tag sensitive information.

### 4.2: Isolate systems storing or processing sensitive information
* Implement separate subscriptions and/or management groups for development, test, and production. 
* Integration Runtimes should be separated by virtual network (VNet)/subnet and tagged appropriately.

### 4.3 Monitor and block unauthorized transfer of sensitive information
* For data sources (such as Azure SQL Database) storing or processing sensitive information for your Azure Data Factory deployment, mark the related resources as sensitive using tags.

### 4.4 Encrypt all sensitive information in transit

* For Azure Storage, use HTTPS in the connection string.

### 4.5 Use an active discovery tool to identify sensitive data
 * If using ADF to copy and transform your Azure SQL Database instances, use the Azure SQL Database data discovery and classification feature.

 ### 4.6 Use Azure RBAC to control access to resources
 * Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to control access to the Azure Data Factory control plane (the Azure portal).

 ### 4.7 Use host-based data loss prevention to enforce access control
 * Data identification, classification, and loss prevention features are not yet available for Azure Storage or compute resources. Implement third-party solution if required for compliance purposes.

 ### 4.8 Encrypt sensitive information at rest
* Enable the data encryption mechanism for any data stores related to your Azure Data Factory deployments.

### 4.9 Log and alert on changes to critical Azure resources
* Use Azure Monitor with the Azure Activity Log to create alerts for when changes take place to Azure Data Factory and related resources.
