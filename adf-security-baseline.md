### 1.7: Manage traffic to web applications
N/A

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

* Use Azure Activity Log to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes for network resources related to ADF instances. 
* Create alerts within Azure Monitor that will trigger when changes to critical network resources take place.

## 2. Logging and Monitoring
### 2.1: Use approved time synchronization sources
* Microsoft maintains the time source used for Azure resources, such as Azure Data Factory for timestamps in the logs.

* New processes created on the VM are recorded by EventLog and monitored by Security Centerâ€™s detection services.

## 3. Identity and Access control
### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts
* Ensure to track and reconcile user access on a regular basis. To create Data Factory instances, the user account used to sign in to Azure must be a member of the contributor or owner role, or an administrator of the Azure subscription.
* Use the Azure AD PowerShell module to perform ad hoc queries to discover accounts that are members of administrative groups that have administrative access to the control plane of ADF instances.
* If running Self-Hosted IR, VM running Self-Hosted IR may have local accounts as well. Both local and domain accounts should be reviewed and managed, normally with a minimum footprint.
* Use PIM Just-in-Time VM access to reduce the availability of administrative permissions

* Ingest data into Azure Sentinel for further investigation.

### 3.13: Provide Microsoft with access to relevant customer data during support scenarios
* In support scenarios where Microsoft needs to access customer data, Azure Customer Lockbox provides an interface for customers to review and approve or reject customer data access requests. 
* While Azure Lockbox is not available for ADF itself, Azure Lockbox does support Azure SQL Database and Azure Virtual Machines.

## 4. Data Protection
